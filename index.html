            This virtual zine details the ways war integrates itself within our daily lives and how we can combat
            against it. This topic was chosen after asking myself "how could someone willingly take part in these atrocities?"
            This lead me to exploring how civilian life can be complicit in war efforts, whether knowingly or unknowingly. In fact,
            I would say that in most cases, the greatest evils are not from direct combatants, but from the civil society that supports it.

            <div class = "quote">
                "The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil."
                <br>— Hannah Arendt

                The concept of the banality of evil was coined by Hannah Arendt in her book Eichmann in Jerusalem.
                WIthin the book Arendt tries to understand how Eichmann, a seemingly normal functioning person could
                commit the atrocities he did. 
                <br><br>
                She concluded that evil acts are often not made by people that could be instantly recognized as being
                monsters or exceptionally evil in nature, instead being mostly regular people who simply act without
                thinking critically about their actions. Simple bureacratic actions can result in somone becoming a cog
                to a much greater evil with the individual either not knowing or not feeling as if their role was large 
                enough to feel guilty over it. Even if the role is small, enough people contributing to evil in these
                small ways is where evil is born.

                The military has weasaled its way into almost all levels of US's education. You only need have gone to
                public school in the United States to know this. It is not an uncommon sight to see military recruiters
                set up a table at a highschool. It's also not uncommon for them to contact incoming college freshmen
                to offer them some sort of career. Furthormore, much of upper education in fields like computer science 
                and engineering have moved to centralize themselves to militarisitc benefit.
                <br><br>
                According to Nicohlas Turse, by 2003 the US Department of Defence had spent a total of 615 milion dollars
                in support of academic research, however this was "was dwarfed by the Pentagon's prime contract awards to 
                just two schools, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Johns Hopkins University which, together, 
                raked in a combined total of $842,437,294."

                Entertainment has a long and deep rooted history with the US military. They help eachother out here 
                and there when they find that they can both benefit. In fact, according to Lee Grieveson and Haidee Wasson
                much of early Cinema was used to showcase new military technologies. 
                <br>
                <br>
                More recently, the United States military has started to get a foothold on the gaming industry as a method
                of propaganda.

                "The mask of humanity fall from capital. It has to take it off to kill everyone -- everything you love; 
                all the hope and tenderness in the world. It has to take it off, just for one second. To do the deed."

                    In Paradoxes of the Warfare State, Elwin H. Powell speaks about how massive the United States defence expenditures are.
                He sites a US congressional committee which states that in the year 1964 that the defence budget would be "almost twice 
                as large as the total US expenditure for public education." According to Business Insider, the defence budget for 2022 was 
                over 10 times the size of the education fund.
                <br><br>
                    This just goes to show how much warfare has been prioritized in the US since then. Powell compares the US military to a corporation,
                he describes how indoctornation is used and how above all obidence is valued in a soldier. Like a corporation, the military's
                main goal is simply to keep existing, even when it comes at the cost of others and itself.
                <br><br>
                    Industry both contributes and feeds off of war efforts.

            <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                
                With so much of public life being ingrained to benefit war and the intrests of the military, is there anything we can do
                to combat this? It may seem impossible but it very much is. It would require a collective effort of many to recognize 
                the affect their actions have and conciously make the choice to avoid contribution to the war machine. Even small actions
                like boycotting certain companies and products can make a difference when done en masse.
